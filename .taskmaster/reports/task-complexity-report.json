			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Retry Logic and Circuit Breaker",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the implementation of retry logic with exponential backoff and circuit breaker pattern into subtasks including: 1) Add CLI flags for retry configuration (--retry-count, --retry-delay), 2) Implement exponential backoff calculation function, 3) Add retry wrapper around net.DialTimeout in Check() method, 4) Create CircuitBreaker struct with state management (closed/open/half-open), 5) Add CLI flags for circuit breaker configuration (--circuit-threshold, --circuit-timeout), 6) Integrate circuit breaker with URL checking logic, 7) Update ExporterState to track circuit breaker states per URL, 8) Add Prometheus metrics for retry attempts and circuit breaker states",
			"reasoning": "This task requires significant architectural changes to the existing codebase. The main.go file already has a well-established checking mechanism, worker pool, and state management. Adding retry logic requires wrapping the existing net.DialTimeout calls with retry logic and exponential backoff. The circuit breaker pattern needs a new state management system that tracks failures per URL and manages state transitions. Integration with the existing ExporterState and metrics system adds complexity. The task touches multiple areas: CLI flag parsing, core checking logic, state management, and metrics."

		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Add Configuration File Support",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down configuration file support into subtasks: 1) Define configuration schema struct matching all CLI flags plus group configurations, 2) Add --config CLI flag for specifying configuration file path, 3) Implement YAML parsing using gopkg.in/yaml.v3 library, 4) Implement JSON parsing using standard library, 5) Create auto-detection logic for file format based on extension or content, 6) Implement configuration merging logic where CLI flags override file values, 7) Add validation and error handling with helpful messages for invalid configurations",
			"reasoning": "The codebase already has JSON support through encoding/json but lacks YAML support, requiring a new dependency. The existing importFromFileWithGroups function shows the codebase already handles file-based configuration for URLs with groups. Adding full configuration file support requires defining a comprehensive schema that covers all existing CLI flags, implementing parsers for both formats, and creating a merge strategy. The complexity is moderate as the pattern exists but needs expansion to cover all configuration options."

		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Alert Webhooks",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 9,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down webhook implementation into subtasks: 1) Add CLI flags for webhook configuration (--webhook-url, --webhook-secret, --alert-cooldown), 2) Create WebhookNotifier struct with HTTP client and configuration, 3) Define webhook payload JSON schema for different event types, 4) Implement state change detection logic in ExporterState, 5) Add debounce mechanism with cooldown tracking per URL/event type, 6) Implement HMAC signature generation for webhook authentication, 7) Create webhook sender with retry logic and error handling, 8) Integrate webhook notifications into worker pool processing, 9) Add Prometheus metrics for webhook send attempts and failures",
			"reasoning": "This is a complex feature requiring new components not present in the codebase. It needs HTTP client implementation for sending webhooks, state change detection (the current ExporterState tracks states but doesn't detect changes), a debounce mechanism to prevent alert flooding, HMAC authentication implementation, and integration with the existing worker pool. The task also depends on the circuit breaker implementation (task 7) for detecting circuit state changes. Multiple webhook URLs support adds additional complexity."

			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Add Comprehensive Testing and Documentation",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 10,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down testing and documentation into subtasks: 1) Analyze current test coverage with go test -cover and identify gaps, 2) Write unit tests for retry logic and exponential backoff functions, 3) Write unit tests for circuit breaker state transitions, 4) Create integration tests for Prometheus exporter mode with mock HTTP server, 5) Write unit tests for webhook notification system including HMAC validation, 6) Add benchmark tests for concurrent URL checking performance, 7) Update README.md with new CLI flags and configuration examples, 8) Create Docker Compose example with Prometheus and Grafana setup, 9) Design and export Grafana dashboard JSON for URL monitoring, 10) Add inline code documentation for all new functions and structs",
			"reasoning": "Current test coverage is minimal (only 3 test functions in main_test.go). The task requires comprehensive testing for all new features from tasks 7-9, plus the existing features that lack tests. The codebase has basic documentation in README.md but needs updates for all new features. Creating integration tests, benchmarks, and Docker Compose examples requires significant effort. The Grafana dashboard creation requires understanding of the metrics exposed and dashboard JSON format."

			"taskId": 11,
			"taskTitle": "Documentation",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Create comprehensive documentation including: 1) Expand README.md with detailed feature descriptions, installation guides, and troubleshooting section, 2) Create ARCHITECTURE.md documenting system design, worker pool pattern, and state management, 3) Write API.md documenting all Prometheus metrics with labels and meanings, 4) Create CONFIGURATION.md with all CLI flags, environment variables, and config file options, 5) Add code examples directory with practical use cases and integration patterns, 6) Generate godoc comments for public APIs and ensure documentation completeness",
			"reasoning": "While the codebase has a basic README.md, it lacks comprehensive documentation. The task is moderately complex as it requires understanding the entire codebase architecture, including the worker pool pattern, ExporterState management, metrics system, and group health calculations. Documentation needs to cover existing features plus all new features from other tasks. The complexity is reduced as this is primarily a writing task rather than implementation."
